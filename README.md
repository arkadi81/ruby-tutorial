Learning basics of ruby

- interpretted rather than compiled
-  fully object oriented
- whitespace independent
- no semicolons

usage
- cli single command
- from file
- irb

puts - prints to terminal / screen automatically adds return
print - doesnt add line return

- name files with .rb extension

- comments: # comments go after pound sign


## IRB / irb --simple-prompt
nil = success run code

- everything is a method. strings too. eg "hello".reverse

- ri (ruby information!) works from cli

technically, variables are not objects, but references to obj.
