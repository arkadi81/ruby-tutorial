#naming convension - all lowercase + underscore, NOT CAMEL

#scope indicators:
# globals $var
# Class @@var
# instance @var
# local var
# Block var

# x +=2 works
# var.class shows which class var belongs to
# Integer -> Bignum or Fixnum (differnce in size. ruby will take care of correct assignemnt
# and change as needed)

# -200.abs absolute value.
# 200.next = 201
# Floats: (decimals, as std) 10.class = Fixnum, 10.0.class = Float
# int / int will lose precision, acts like div. for precise calculations, use floats!
# 123.345.round
# 123.322.to_i will convert to integer
# .floor rounds down
# .ceil (cieling rounds up)
